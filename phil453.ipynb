    "\n",
    "\"We address, among other things, the idea that events are governed by non intentional principles; that there is a single fundamental principle of all phenomena; the concept of dynamic structure; that nothning can be truly created or destroyed; that change disperses being; and the concept of atomic composition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the final unit we turn to study Greece's paradigmatic philosopher of nature, Aristotle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here we examine his watershed arguments that materiality exists; the distinction between nature and artifice; the sort of reality that belongs to automatic processes; the problem of emergence; and the argument that events occur because being is structured, and therefore oriented, by soul.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These thinkers blaze paths for thinking nature for our civilization, and by retreading these paths we can discover ways of experiencing natural phenomena that were left begind and set aside.\""
